## Phase 1: Backend Enhancement - atomic tasks
To keep tasks as small as possible, this is output of Windsurf Claude 3.7 Sonnet Thinking model during the planning session for phase 1 implementation

Here's a more granular breakdown of Phase 1: Backend Enhancement into smaller atomic tasks:

Phase 1: Backend Enhancement - Detailed Tasks
Update Server-Side Statistics API
 1.1 Modify pictController.js to call pict.stats() alongside test generation
 1.2 Create new response format that includes both test cases and statistics
 1.3 Add error handling for statistics generation failures
Extend Statistics Calculation Logic
 2.1 Create a statisticsCalculations.js utility module in the server
 2.2 Implement calculateTheoreticalMax(model) function to determine all possible combinations
 2.3 Implement calculateCoveragePercentage(generated, total) function
 2.4 Implement calculateEfficiency(generated, theoretical) function
 2.5 Implement calculateConstraintReduction(theoretical, combinations) function
Create Enhanced Statistics Interface
 3.1 Define EnhancedPictNodeStatistics interface extending the base statistics
 3.2 Add fields for order, coveragePercentage, efficiency, and constraintReduction
 3.3 Document the interface with JSDoc comments
API Endpoint Development
 4.1 Update /api/generate endpoint to include enhanced statistics
 4.2 Create new /api/stats endpoint for standalone statistics generation
 4.3 Add options parameter support for different order values (2, 3, 4)
Backend Unit Tests
 5.1 Create unit tests for all statistics calculation functions
 5.2 Test edge cases (empty model, single parameter, large models)
 5.3 Test different order values (2, 3, 4)
 5.4 Test with and without constraints
Backend Integration Tests
 6.1 Test API endpoints with various model configurations
 6.2 Test response format and data accuracy
 6.3 Test error scenarios and handling
Documentation
 7.1 Update API documentation to reflect new statistics capabilities
 7.2 Add code comments explaining statistics calculation logic
 7.3 Document any performance considerations for statistics generation
This detailed breakdown provides clear, actionable tasks for implementing the backend enhancement phase, making it easier to track progress and ensure all aspects are covered.
