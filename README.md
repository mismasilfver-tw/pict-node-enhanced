This library is a wrapper around Microsoft's [PICT](https://github.com/microsoft/pict) (Pairwise Independent Combinatorial Testing) tool, designed to work with Node.js for generating combinations of inputs for software testing. PICT is a powerful tool that helps reduce the number of tests needed while still ensuring comprehensive coverage by generating optimized combinations of inputs.

The library boasts excellent **TypeScript** support! ðŸª„

> Before using this library, it's helpful to read Microsoft's official [PICT documentation](https://github.com/Microsoft/pict/blob/main/doc/pict.md) to learn about the tool and how it works.

## Overview

Imagine you have a function for creating order that accepts 6 parameters with several possible values for each argument.

| Parameter      | Possible Values                          |
| -------------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Location       | Poland, Lithuania, Germany, USA          |
| Customer       | Individuals, Companies, Partners         |
| Time           | 05:00, 11:99, 15:00, 21:30, 23:59        |
| Payment System | VISA, MasterCard, PayPal, WebMoney, Qiwi |
| Product        | 1732, 319, 872, 650                      |
| Discount       | true, false                              |

This model has many possible combinations, which means we could have thousands of test cases to write and test. However, it's not practical to test all of them manually and in a reasonable amount of time. Instead, we can generate and test all possible pairs of values to achieve a good level of coverage.

```js
import { pict } from "pict-node";

const model = [
  {
    key: "location",
    values: ["Poland", "Lithuania", "Germany", "USA"],
  },
  {
    key: "customer",
    values: ["Individuals", "Companies", "Partners"],
  },
  {
    key: "time",
    values: ["05:00", "11:99", "15:00", "21:30", "23:59"],
  },
  {
    key: "paymentSystem",
    values: ["VISA", "MasterCard", "PayPal", "WebMoney", "Qiwi"],
  },
  {
    key: "product",
    values: [
      {
        id: 1732,
      },
      {
        id: 319,
      },
      {
        id: 872,
      },
      {
        id: 650,
      },
    ],
  },
  {
    key: "discount",
    values: [true, false],
  },
];

const cases = await pict({ model });
```

PICT will generate the following test cases:

```js
[
  // ... ... ...
  {
    location: "Lithuania",
    customer: "Individuals",
    time: "23:59",
    paymentSystem: "Qiwi",
    product: { id: 650 },
    discount: true,
  },
  {
    location: "USA",
    customer: "Partners",
    time: "05:00",
    paymentSystem: "VISA",
    product: { id: 319 },
    discount: false,
  },
  // ... ... ...
  {
    location: "Poland",
    customer: "Companies",
    time: "23:59",
    paymentSystem: "MasterCard",
    product: { id: 1732 },
    discount: true,
  },
  // ... ... ...
];
```

## Web Interface

PICT-Node now includes a web interface for interactive test case generation. This provides a user-friendly way to:

- Define test models through a visual editor
- Generate test cases with a single click
- View and export test cases in various formats
- Load example models to get started quickly

### Using the Web Interface

1. Start the web interface:

```sh
# Start both the server and web interface in development mode
npm run dev

# Or start only the server in production mode
npm start
```

2. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:3001`

3. Use the interface to create your test model and generate test cases

For more details, see the [Web Interface README](./web-interface/README.md).

## Create Test Cases

In most cases, to create test cases, you can use the `pict` function. The main feature of this function is that you can use any data type for the values.

```js
import { pict } from "pict-node";
import { createOrder } from "./src";

// Define test model
const model = [
  {
    key: "country",
    values: ["USA", "Canada", "Germany"],
  },
  {
    key: "age",
    values: [10, 16, 18, 25, 70],
  },
  {
    key: "product",
    values: [{ id: 50 }, { id: 350 }],
  },
];

// Generate test cases
const cases = await pict({ model });

// Iterate test cases
for (const { country, age, product } of cases) {
  // Call a function with the current test case
  const result = createOrder({
    country,
    age,
    product,
  });

  // Verify that the function returns the expected result
  expect(result).toBe("The order has been created");
}
```

By default, `pict-node` generates a pair-wise test suite (all pairs covered), but the order can be set by option `order` to a value larger than two.

```js
const cases = await pict(
  {
    model,
  },
  {
    order: 3,
  }
);
```

    {
      key: "size",
      values: ["10", "100", "500", "1000"],
    },
  ],
  constraints: ['IF [type] = "Primary" THEN [size] <= 500;'],
});
```

The following are potential improvements to the constraints editor UI to make it more user-friendly:

1. **Parameter Autocomplete/Dropdown**

   - Add autocomplete functionality that shows available parameters when typing `[`
   - Display a dropdown of available parameters that can be inserted with a click
   - Highlight parameter references in a different color for better visibility

2. **Visual Constraint Builder**

   - Create a visual builder with dropdowns for parameters, operators, values, and logical connectors
   - Allow users to build constraints using this interface, which generates the proper syntax

3. **Syntax Validation and Error Highlighting**

   - Add real-time syntax validation as users type
   - Highlight errors with red underlines and tooltips explaining the issue
   - Provide suggestions to fix common errors (like adding/removing quotes for numeric values)

4. **Type-Aware Value Formatting**

   - Automatically format values based on parameter type (string, numeric, boolean)
   - For numeric parameters, automatically remove quotes
   - For string parameters, automatically add quotes if missing

5. **Template Library**

   - Provide a library of common constraint templates (IF-THEN, AND/OR combinations, etc.)
   - Allow users to select a template and fill in the parameters and values

6. **Constraint Groups and Organization**

   - Allow grouping related constraints
   - Add collapsible sections for different constraint groups
   - Provide a way to enable/disable constraints without removing them

7. **Visual Feedback on Constraint Impact**

   - Show a preview of how many test cases would be affected by each constraint
   - Provide visual indicators of constraint "strength" (how much it reduces the test space)
   - Allow users to see which test cases would be eliminated by each constraint

8. **Improved Constraint List**

   - Color-code constraints by type (IF-THEN, simple equality, etc.)
   - Add icons representing the constraint type
   - Allow inline editing of existing constraints
   - Add a search/filter function for constraints

9. **Constraint Wizard for Beginners**

   - Add a "Constraint Wizard" that walks users through creating constraints step by step
   - Provide examples specific to the current model parameters
   - Include tooltips and help text throughout the interface

10. **Keyboard Shortcuts and Accessibility**
    - Add keyboard shortcuts for common operations
    - Ensure the interface is fully accessible with screen readers
    - Add tab navigation between constraint components
