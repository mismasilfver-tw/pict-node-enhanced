This file demonstrates one of the plan.md files created by Windsurf planning mode during one of the interface implementation sessions.



# Research Plan: PICT Algorithm Statistics & Coverage

## Notes
- User wants to understand how statistics and coverage are calculated for 2-way, 3-way, and 4-way PICT algorithms.
- The `order` parameter controls n-way coverage: order=2 (pairwise), order=3 (3-way), order=4 (4-way), etc.
- PICT statistics include: total possible combinations, generated tests, and coverage ratio (generatedTests / combinations * 100).
- Coverage means all n-way combinations (pairs, triplets, etc.) are covered at least once in the generated test suite for the specified order.
- The calculation logic is implemented in the codebase and is also documented in PICT documentation and statistics-implementation.md.
- Next step: Plan implementation logic for calculating and displaying statistics/coverage based on user's n-way selection (2-way, 3-way, 4-way), and define UI presentation strategy.
- Add information button to statistics component to show users an explanation of what the numbers mean, using detailed breakdown (combination calculation, coverage guarantee, example, constraints impact).
- For each implementation phase, create tests according to the test pyramid (unit, integration, end-to-end) to ensure robust coverage and quality.
- Implementation phases: Backend enhancement, Basic statistics display, Advanced visualizations, Interactive features. Each phase must include unit, integration, and E2E tests as per the test pyramid (70/20/10 split). Information button/modal requirements and file/component structure are included in the plan.

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Backend Enhancement
- Extend statistics calculation logic and API
- Add theoretical maximum calculation
- Unit, integration, and E2E tests for backend logic

### Phase 2: Basic Statistics Display
- Create StatisticsPanel component
- Add toggle and information button/modal with explanations
- Unit, integration, and E2E tests for UI and modal

### Phase 3: Advanced Visualizations
- Integrate charting (donut/bar/estimates)
- Unit and integration tests for visualization components

### Phase 4: Interactive Features
- Real-time updates, export, history
- Unit, integration, and E2E tests for interactive/statistics flow

## Task List
- [ ] Research the calculation of statistics and coverage for n-way (2, 3, 4) PICT algorithms
- [ ] Document findings in a concise summary
- [ ] Plan implementation logic for statistics/coverage calculation depending on user n-way selection (2-way, 3-way, 4-way)
- [ ] Plan how to present the statistics and coverage clearly in the user interface
- [ ] Create an information button in the statistics component to display an explanation for users about what the statistics mean (combination calculation, coverage guarantee, examples, constraints impact)
- [ ] For each implementation phase, create tests according to the test pyramid (unit, integration, end-to-end)
- [ ] Implement backend enhancement, basic statistics display, advanced visualizations, and interactive features, each with corresponding tests

## Current Goal
Implement Coverage Statistics Component with Test Pyramid
